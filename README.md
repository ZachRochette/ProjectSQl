# Overview

In this project I am taking my first look at SQL relational databases. I use python, tkinter, and sqlite3 to create a very simple login. This was my first time ever messing with tkinter, and sqlite3 and databases in general. The purpose of this project was to serve as an introduction to the world of databases. I have a lot to learn about them and I learned a lot while doing this small project.

# Relational Database

I used SQLite which is a relational database management system, or (RDBMS) 
Tkinter creates the login window, and sqlite3 and python allow us to enter our credentials and login to our non existing page. 
I created a table that stores usernames, and passwords.

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- Python
- Tkinter
- SQlite3

# Useful Websites

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

There are many things I would like to implement in this project

- A register page
- Put it on the web and use webpages to display everything instead of Tkinter
- Let the user enter their login credentials instead of having to enter them directly into the database using an SQL statement
